## 📂 Folder Structure

### `Logic & Loops/`

This section covers the **core building blocks of programming** using JavaScript.

- ✅ **Start with:** `Logic & Loops/README.md`
- 📘 **Topics Covered:**
  - Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
  - Looping (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
  - Flow control and iteration patterns
- 🧠 **Assignment:** `Logic & Loops/assignment.md`

---

### `Paradigms/`

This section introduces various **programming paradigms** — the styles or philosophies behind how code is written and organized.

- ✅ **Start with:** `Paradigms/README.md`
- 📘 **Paradigms Introduced:**
  - Procedural Programming
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Functional Programming
  - Declarative Programming
- 🧠 **Assignment:** `Paradigms/assignments.md`

---

## `OOP & Intro to Databases/`

Explores **object-oriented principles** in depth and introduces **relational databases**.

- ✅ Start here: `OOP & Intro to Databases/README.md`
- 📘 Topics:
  - Core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - Using objects and classes in JavaScript
  - Basic data modeling concepts and SQL relationships (e.g., one-to-many)
- 🧠 Assignment included in folder (embedded in the README)

## 🛠 How to Use This Module

1. Start with `Logic & Loops` if you're new to conditionals and iteration.
2. Move to `Paradigms` to explore more abstract and reusable ways of structuring code.
3. Proceed to `OOP & Intro to Databases` for a deep dive into Object Oriented Programming and a soft introduction to databases
4. Complete each assignment as you progress — they are designed to reinforce what you've learned.
5. Ask for help if you're stuck or unsure — this is foundational material for everything that comes next.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- A working JavaScript environment (browser console or Node.js)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic terminal/Git knowledge (for version control and file navigation)
- Basic familiarity with variables and functions

## 🧠 Why This Structure?

This repo reflects the natural progression of a junior software engineer's journey:

1. **Logic & Loops** teaches you to think like a machine.
2. **Paradigms** helps you choose *how* you want to think.
3. **OOP & Databases** equips you to model the real world and store data sustainably.
